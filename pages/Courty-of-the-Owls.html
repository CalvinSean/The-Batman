                    Look, Bruce. No one knows Gotham better than you. It's your city. It's <strong>Batman's city</strong>... <br>But it's also nearly
                    four hundred years old. Which means over the years, maybe it <br>belonged <strong>to something else</strong>, too. Something big.

        They are a violent cabal who use architecture and murder to wield political influence throughout history. 
        Their legend is told only through whispers and a nursery rhyme that bears their name. To carry out their 
        interests, they employ a breed of highly-trained assassins known as Talons. The leaders of the organization 
        appear to be human and wear owl masks on their faces. The rest of the court, on the other hand, are mutated 
        and appear to actually be human/owl hybrids. Their owl-like distorted faces, long claws, and their eating 
        style prove this.

            The Court of Owls takes notice when billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne announces plans to rebuild and 
            reshape Gotham City for the future.[3] He is sentenced to death, and their assassin, the Talon, attempts to 
            murder him during a meeting with politician Lincoln March. They struggle at the top of Wayne Tower and the 
            killer survives a fall from the top.[4] Batman begins to investigate, and he discovers that their society has 
            secret headquarters throughout hidden rooms in every building established by the Alan Wayne Trust. They 
            attempt to kill him again by blowing up their most recent base.[5] Bruce recounts that as a child he believed 
            them responsible for the death of his parents, and personally investigated the conspiracy before determining 
            that there was no evidence.
